# FINAL SOLUTION - Disable Auto-Simulation Completely

I'm going to take a different approach. Instead of trying to fix the auto-confirm, I'll **completely disable the auto-simulation feature** and make everything 100% manual.

This will GUARANTEE that cars cannot enter without manual button clicks.

## Changes I'll Make:

1. **Remove auto-simulation interval** - No more automatic car generation
2. **Keep only manual entry** - Cars can only be added via camera "محاكاة سريعة" button
3. **Force manual confirmation** - Every entry MUST be manually confirmed

This way, it's IMPOSSIBLE for cars to enter automatically because there's no auto-simulation running at all.

## Testing After This Change:

1. The "تشغيل المحاكاة" button will be removed/disabled
2. You can only add cars manually using the camera feed button
3. Each car will require manual print button click
4. No auto-entry possible

Would you like me to implement this solution? This will completely solve the auto-entry issue by removing the auto-simulation feature entirely.

**Reply "yes" if you want me to disable auto-simulation completely.**
